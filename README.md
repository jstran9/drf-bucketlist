# Reference Repository

- This is a repository following this [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1).
- I am making this repository because I went over a tutorial on the DjangoRestFramework site and although it is very comprehensive and covers many topics I feel I need to go through more examples before I can become comfortable using the framework.
